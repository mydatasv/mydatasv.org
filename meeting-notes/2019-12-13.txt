We have divided the main tasks in 4 groups. All of us will bring ideas and participate
in all of them as much as possible but we have chosen leaders for each of them . These are
the groups:

1.- Sponsors: Kathy and Sari will be leading this group
2.- Program: Johannes will lead this one. Soren and Paul and Mark will co-operate.
3.- Venue: Kaliya will be leading this part in cooperation with group 3.
