What we decided to do:
We decided to concentrate on two different ways of action

1. Full-moon Events

An ongoing event at the Node every full-moon
Should be focused on Ethics, Privacy and Personal Data.
Event on privacy and data rights: Ethical use of data. What new can we do with data now
that we have private data?
Ongoing discussion on personal data? After this first meeting, we should be able to decide
how to organize ourselves and what are our responsibilities.
The first event will be held on July 16 Tuesday, 2019 at Node from 6pm to 8 pm
August 15th
September 13th
Marketing: Eventbrite, Facebook, Meetup.

What networks do we get connected with? IIW, etc.

What is success for the event? Engagement. 20-30 people that can make a difference.
Accelerating the mission statement for MyData.  We divided marketing work for the event.
Node will provide space and wine, and Sari will bring chips.

2. Marketing MyData

We felt that important people do not know enough about MyData.  We decided to line up
meetings with important people to market MyData. We set up a sub-team to work on this.
Sari, Jim and Mark will continue discussion on Slack.
